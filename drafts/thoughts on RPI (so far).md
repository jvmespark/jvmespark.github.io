# thoughts on RPI (so far)
### a second year's reflection

who am i
    finished my second year at rpi spring of 2024. since then ive taken time off to pursue my career in 2 internships. the time off has given me lots to think about and reflect on the university. 

why am i writing this?
    ive been built off deeply personal writings from those before me, how could I not share my experiences and give back to the world what i've benefited tremendously from. maybe theres someone out there going through something very similiar, or those who've been in familiar places can find comfort in what i have to say. i know when i was a highschooler. i have no real shame to share publicly my thoughts on the college ive invested years of my maturing age into.

what rpi means to me / my unique experiences there
    mixed feelings. its built my technical skills and given me some of greatest academic nourishment ive been missing. its taken a chance on me that other colleges havent. my career is prospering. but its also stripped me and damaged me. 

how rpi changed me / culture and social life
    its there if you want it. but thats not who i am. so ill tell the perspective of the desolate outcast. 

crisis and burnout / lonely winters
    "sometimes the things i want to accomplish require me to be deeply alone for long stretches of time"
"the brick and mortar middle of nowhere campus from the 80s sets an implicit mood that I caught deeply. freshman winter no music, youtube, movies, content in general, truly deep work, one of the more formative periods of my life"

reputation.
    decline. bring up all the statistics. im buying low and selling high. i see the hidden gem in it.  

academics.
    some of the strongest academics ive seen. crumbling infastructure behind me.
thoughts on future of rpi. i see potential seeds hidden deep in the student body and the academics, but there is still tremendous effort, strength, and patience required to savor the fruits. 

disappointments.

what needs to happen next.
