# an interns guide to DC
### musings from my time at Capital One

summer 2024 ive interned at capital one.
i was placed in dc as part of their provided national corporate housing.
i was one of the rare few (3 out of 68 other interns) to be placed in dc proper
it ended up being of the most natural fits for me and ive had a really amazing time
to pass the torch to any future dc interns

musuems
    some of my favorite parts of nyc is the met and moma. naturally the first museums ive sought out once arriving in dc was the art collections.
    the very first was the national potrait gallery, 2 blocks from my apartment.
    the most visited was the national gallery west building

monuments

locations

trains

summer activities

how to stay safe (and what not to do)
    avoid gallery place / chinatown metro station
    if riding late at night dont get in a car by yourself
    stay alert

    generally ive found no real threats to my life or wellbeing
    stay in the national gallery area and dont venture too far up 
    north west is safe
